							<h3>Co-CEO</h3>
							<p>David began working part-time for Phototype while he was still in high school, and continued on through his college years. Those early years were certainly humbling &ndash; sweeping floors, making deliveries and proofing.</p>
							<p>He began college at Ohio State University and later transferred to Rochester Institute of Technology wherehe earned his B.A. in Photography, with a minor in Printing in 1989.  After graduation,he joined Phototype full-time and led the move of the company photo lab (PhotoArt) toward the main office &ndash; he quickly added a photo studio and began shooting as well. In 1993, he moved to Columbus, Ohio, to open Phototyp&rsquo;s second manufacturing operation, which he continues to lead today. David later went to Ohio University, where he earned his M.B.A. in 1998.</p>
							<p>His responsibilities now include overseeing all financial and technology aspects of the company, as well as traveling internationally to visit client manufacturing and service facilities. In 2008, David was appointed to the Board at Printing Industries of America (PIA), the world&rsquo;s largest graphic arts trade association. In November 2014, he was sworn in as PIA&rsquo;s Chairman, charged with driving further advancement of the graphics communications industry worldwide.</p>
