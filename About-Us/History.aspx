							<h2>It all began in 1919 with three men who shared a common passion for delivering high-quality work and superior service. With just $4,000 between them, they acted on that passion and opened up a small production shop in Cincinnati, Ohio and named it Phototype Engraving. The rest, as they say, is history&hellip;</h2>

								<h2>1919</h2>
								<h3>Birth of Phototype Engraving Inc</h3>
								<p>Founding members were Ed Lemker (shown here), George Maier and Otto Busch. With just $4,000 between them, they opened shop in the Atlas Bank Building in Cincinnati, OH. The company soon became incorporated in the State of Ohio and was one of the first businesses in the region to use revolutionary photo-etching techniques.</p>

								<h2>1928</h2>
								<h3>Business is booming</h3>
								<p>Phototype moved to a larger facility at 214 East Ninth Street. In those early days, daily operations included photographing type, etching the type in metal, mounting it on wood and printing from the mounted plate.</p>

								<h3>Enter the 2nd generation</h3>
								<p>Ed Lemker&rsquo;s nephew, Dick Olberding (right), joined as an apprentice cameraman/ salesman and helped manage the comzpany with his uncle following the retirement of George Maier (and the earlier passing of Otto Busch). Ed became sole owner of Phototype, having acquired Georgeâ€™s shares at his retirement.</p>

								<h3>Procter &amp; Gamble becomes a client</h3>
								<p>The company rented an adjoining floor at 216 East Ninth Street, to better accommodatea prospective client, Procter&amp; Gamble. P&amp;G saw potential in Phototype&rsquo;s services, and negotiations for their mat and proof contracts ensued. With a growing number of accounts, Phototype invested in its first offset press, a 29" Harris Press, and a few multiliths, and created a co-company called Parr Printing to handle the expanding number of proofs needed.</p>
