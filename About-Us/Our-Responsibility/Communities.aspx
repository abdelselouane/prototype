                                <p>We&rsquo;re an active, engaged neighbor who strives to make a difference in the communities around us. We link employee volunteers with important social programs that positively impact youth, their families, and their living environments.</p>
								
								<p>In the spirit of service to others, employees are encouraged to take up to one day a year, with pay, to volunteer at a sponsored, non-profit organization. Some of our current partners include:</p>
                                
                                <h3>Ronald McDonald House</h3>
								<p>Providing a supportive home-away-from-home for families and their children who are receiving medical treatment at Cincinnati Children&rsquo;s Hospital or other area hospitals.</p>
								
                                <h3>Lighthouse Youth Services</h3>
								<p>Advancing the dignity and well-being of children, youth and families in need and encouraging good 	citizenship, responsible behavior and self-reliance.</p>
								
                                <h3>Habitat for Humanity</h3>
								<p>Eliminating substandard housing locally and worldwide through constructing, rehabilitating and preserving 	homes.</p>
								
                                <h3>Cincinnati Parks Association</h3>
								<p>Maintaining numerous urban parks and green spaces throughout the city, including cleaning up wooded 	areas, planting flowers and trees and building bridges/trails.</p>
								<img src="../../images/general/Our_Responsibility_communities.png" alt="Communities" class="img-radius lower-left-image full-width"/>

								<br>
								<p>We also lend support to programs that are important to our clients, including Boys & Girls Clubs of America, the Wounded Warrior Project, The Salvation Army, and The United Way. Additionally, our employees give generously of their own time, talent and treasure to support local programs that may have personal meaning and impact.</p>

								<p>By harnessing the energy and enthusiasm of our entire Phototype team, we make a vital connection and contribution to our communities.</p>
