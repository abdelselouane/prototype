                                <h3>Our ability to seamlessly integrate the <em>art of design</em> with the <em>science  of execution</em>, in a highly efficient and effective way, is the unique value  we bring to our <a href="javascript:;">clients</a>, everyday.</h3>

								<p>Typically, getting from design to press requires multiple tasks and hand-offs  between designers, production artists, assemblers, and print suppliers. These individuals  may work in different departments or even for different companies. Managing  that complex process, while still considering the needs of the downstream  partner, can be a big challenge. All too often, initial files need to be rebuilt  or modified (some multiple times) before they can be proofed and printed. This  can result in compromised designs, unexpected errors, longer turnarounds and  additional production costs. </p>
								
								<p>There is a better way. With our SmartArt&#8480; process, the difference is  radical in both process and outcome.</p>
								
								<ul class="list">
								  <li><h3>We design with the end in mind</h3>
									<p>Designs are developed and delivered  with upfront, intimate knowledge of the &ldquo;downstream&rdquo; execution process. As a result, your design and  production file is <em>always </em>constructed  correctly from the very beginning,  so it can be reliably and accurately reproduced later.</p></li>
								</ul>
								
								<ul type="disc">
								  <li><h3>We execute with scientific precision</h3><p>Original design intent is meticulously  maintained by leveraging tools like digital design files, print-ready <a href="javascript:;">production art</a> and <a href="javascript:;">electronic  assembly</a>, proprietary <a href="javascript:;">print services</a>, <a href="javascript:;">color management</a> and press-side  assistance, all facilitated by a &ldquo;one version of the truth&rdquo; process.  Predictable, reliable results every step of the way. </p>
								  </li>
								</ul>
								
                                <p>Realize the full potential of SmartArt&#8480; by engaging us in a comprehensive, start-to-finish  customized solution set for your brand or by implementing any one of our  solutions in conjunction with your current processes. Either way, we&rsquo;re  confident that you&rsquo;ll see dramatic results.</p>
